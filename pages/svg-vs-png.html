          <h1>SVGs vs PNGs: Understanding the Key Differences</h1>
          <div class="blue-container">
            <h2>Scalability: A Key Advantage of SVGs</h2>
            <p>
              The "S" in SVG stands for scalable, which means that SVG images
              can be zoomed in or out without losing any clarity. In contrast,
              PNG images are composed of pixels and can become pixelated when
              enlarged.
            </p>
            <h2>The Mathematical Foundation of SVGs</h2>
            <p>
              SVGs are created using mathematical equations to draw shapes and
              lines, making them a natural fit for generating graphics that
              involve mathematical concepts. On the other hand, PNGs are raster
              images composed of thousands of pixels, making them better suited
              for photographic images.
            </p>
            <h2>File Size: SVGs Offer a Significant Advantage</h2>
            <p>
              Because SVGs can be written in code that describes the shapes and
              lines to draw, they typically have a smaller file size compared to
              PNGs, which require storing information about each individual
              pixel.
            </p>
            <h2>Compatibility: PNGs Remain a Widely Accepted Option</h2>
            <p>
              While SVGs are gaining popularity, there are still some websites
              and platforms that only support PNG and JPEG file formats.
              However, it's worth noting that SVGs are compatible with Microsoft
              products and Google Docs.
