UI

- Use an icon for side nav to expand/collapse
- Add Sign Up/ Log In Page to Navigation
- Fix Toggle Quirk ✅
- Add animation on logo
- Add a checkIfValid function to the script to not run the function if the inputs are blank to prevent black borders for non-inputs
- Add intuitive options to multiplication page

Other To Do's

- Adjust the calculateOptimalDimensions function to avoid having just a few items in the last row when possible. ✅
- Instead of covering excess colored groups with white (which looks terrible when saved without a background), only color what is needed or remove excess. ✅
- For fraction division circles, show the portion of the last group as a fraction
- Use an if statement to determine if it's better to alternate between 2 or 3 colors, or even 4
- If more than one row, make the rows more evenly split so it looks better. ✅
- Add labels to division models
- Add labels to multiplication models
- Make it look more modern and appealing ✅
- Sign up Form ✅
- SVG vs PNG page ✅
- Side bar navigation ✅
- Fix bug in multiplicationAreaModel where some inputs are blank but it's still valid overall and doesn't generate.
- If an input has some blanks but still valid overall, set the blanks to 0.
- Fix line thickness for basic circle model for proper fractions. ✅
- Set download width to only the width needed
- Make division generate for any valid set of inputs with some blanks
- Fix bugs where it colors too much or not enough for division bar
- Add white background option for area model

Customizations to Add

- Change colors
- Change line thickness
- Labels or no labels
- Spacing between items
- Vertical or Horizontal bars
- Drag box to resize width:height ratio
- To scale or not to scale ✅
- With or without a background

Download Options
