UI

- Use an icon for side nav to expand/collapse
- Add Sign Up/ Log In Page to Navigation
- Fix Toggle Quirk ✅

Other To Do's

- Adjust the calculateOptimalDimensions function to avoid having just a few items in the last row when possible. ✅
- Instead of covering excess colored groups with white (which looks terrible when saved without a background), only color what is needed or remove excess. ✅
- For fraction division circles, show the portion of the last group as a fraction
- Use an if statement to determine if it's better to alternate between 2 or 3 colors, or even 4
- If more than one row, make the rows more evenly split so it looks better. ✅
- Add labels to division models
- Add labels to multiplication models
- Make it look more modern and appealing ✅
- Sign up Form ✅
- SVG vs PNG page ✅
- Side bar navigation ✅
- Fix bug in multiplicationAreaModel where some inputs are blank but it's still valid overall and doesn't generate.
- If an input has some blanks but still valid overall, set the blanks to 0.

Customizations to Add
